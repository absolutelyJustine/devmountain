        <p>And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. There we go. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.</p>
        <p>With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. I like to beat the brush. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Let that brush dance around there and play.</p>
        <p>A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Let's get crazy. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint.</p>
        <p>Maybe there's a little something happening right here. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Be brave. There it is. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now.</p>
        <p>The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Just make a decision and let it go. Let your heart be your guide. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.</p>
        <p>Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. In life you need colors. If you hypnotize it, it will go away.</p>
        <p>Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. We wash our brush with odorless thinner.</p>
